2.1 INTRODUCTION

System analysis is a step-by-step process used to identify and develop or acquire
the software need to control the processing of specific application. System analysis is a
continuing activity the stages of the systems development. System analysis is the process of
gathering and interpreting facts, diagnosing problems and using the facts to improve the
system. The outputs from the organization are traced through the various processing that the
input phases through in the organization. This involves gathering information and using
structured tools for analysis. A detailed study of this process must be made by various

techniques like interviews; questionnaires etc.

It is necessary to have such a good system analysis and then by a project development cycle
so that the project can be completed in a strictly manner and able to finish with the desired

time. The analyst must be so careful about his responsibilities.

As the next step the current system analysis is done which identifies the real need
of establishing our project in the environment, its opportunities and constraints etc... All of

the steps discussed above are collectively known as the system analysis.

3. FEASIBILITY ANALYSIS

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 14
One of the important outcomes of the preliminary investigation is the determination of the
feasibility of the system. These are different aspects of the feasibility study in the
investigation phase. After the documents reviewing the selected personnel, investigating the
various resources the following are the three feasibility.
Three key combinations are involved in the feasibility study

e Technical feasibility

« Economic feasibility

e Operational feasibility
3.1 TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY

Technical study is a study of hardware and software requirements .All the
technical issue related to the proposed system is dealt during feasibility stage of preliminary

investigation produced the following results.
3.2 ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY

Economic analysis is the most frequently used method for evaluating the effectiveness of a
candidate system. More commonly known as cost/benefit analysis, the procedure is to
determine the benefit and saving that are expected from a candidate system and compare
them with the term of time by automating the process of report generation. The system can be
developed technically and if installed would still be good for the organization. The cost is
found to be lesser compared to the benefits of the proposed system. The workload of a user
will decrease to half of the current workload. Hence the proposed system is found to be

economic feasible.

3.3 OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY

The developed system is completely driven and user friendly. Also the system is
developed in Visual Basic, which is GUI. There is little need skill for new user to operate the
software. Reports will be exactly as per the requirement. At the beginning of preliminary
investigation work all the personnel approached responded positively this reduces the chance
of resistance to the proposed system. Considering all the issue stated above makes the

proposed system feasible.

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 15
4.1. HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

Selection of hardware configuration is very important task related to the
software development. The processor should be powerful to handle all the operations .
The hard disk should have the sufficient capacity to solve the database and the
application.

Minimum hardware requirements

Processor : Intel Pentium 4 or higher

Processor Speed : 1.5GHz or higher

System bus : 32bits

Memory : 1GB_ RAM or Higher

Hard disk : 40GB or Higher

Monitor : 14” LCD Monitor

Keyboard : 104 keys

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a comprehensive description

of the intended purpose and environment for software under development. The SRS fully

 

describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. An SRS

 

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 17
minimizes the time and effort required by developers to achieve desired goals and also
minimizes the development cost. A good SRS defines how an application will interact with

system hardware, other programs and human users in a wide variety of real-world situations.

4.3 LANGUAGE AND TOOLS USED

4.3.1 FRONT END
The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language that allows web

developers to create dynamic content that interacts with databases. PHP is basically used

for developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base

with PHP.

PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found

out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.
PHP isa recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".

PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic

content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.

It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle,
Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.

PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the
UNIX side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge

result sets in record-setting time.

PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added
support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier

development a possibility for the first time.
PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.

PHP Syntax is C-Like.

Common uses of PHP

PHP performs system functions, i.e. from files on a system it can create, open, read, write, and

close them.

PHP can handle forms, i.e. gather data from files, save data to a file, through email you can send

data, return data to the user.

You add, delete, and modify elements within your database through PHP.
Access cookies variables and set cookies.

Using PHP, you can restrict users to access some pages of your website.

It can encrypt data.

Characteristics of PHP

Five important characteristics make PHP's practical nature possible —

Simplicity
Efficiency
Security

Flexibility

Familiarity

MySQL is the most popular Open Source Relational SQL database management system. MySQL
is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing web-based software applications.

4.3.2 BACK END

MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses.
MySQL is developed, marketed, and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish

company. MySQL is becoming so popular because of many good reasons:

MySQL is released under an open-source license. So you have nothing to pay to use it.

MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the

functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.
MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.

MySQL works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, PERL,
C, CH, JAVA, ete.

MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets.
MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development.

MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file
size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle

it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB).

MySQL is customizable. The open-source GPL license allows programmers to modify the

MySQL software to fit their own specific environments.

4.3.3 OPERATING SYSTEM

The OS used is Windows Operating System. The hall mark software of Microsoft, which had
created a new wave of graphical user interface in the industry, WINDOWS 7 and 10 stands in
the top of its popularity. The advent of Microsoft plus has cured whatever faults were there in
the original WINDOWS 10 version and made it and useful tool to work with the memory
resident programs of it, make the reloading of WINDOWS 10 easier, it plug and play
connectivity for input output devices makes a new dimension towards the use of computer
system. Connectivity to the information networks like Internet through modems makes it

overstate software. Almost all new software has their windows version also. The programmer

and file manager facilities of it had made a leap way towards giving a new dimension

towards the operation of computer systems

DATA FLOW DIAGRAM

To start the system design, something analogue to the architecture blue print as a
starting point to design is required. It is a way to focus on functions rather than physical
implementation. One such tool is a DFD.

Structured analysis is a set of techniques and graphical tools that help the analyst to
develop a new kind of system specification that are easily understandable to the user DFD’s
show the major decompositions of the system functions and their interfaces. The DFD is
graphic and presents a picture of what is being specified and is conceptually easy to
understand presentation of the application.

One important feature of DFD’s is that it is logical rather than physical. The elements
of the system do not depend on vendor or hardware. They specify in precise, concise manner
the working of the system and how it hangs together.

DFD is the graphic representation of data movement process, and files used in support
of an information system. There are several rules of thumb used in drawing DFDs.

e Process should be named and numbered for easy references.

e The direction of flow is from top to bottom and from left to right.

e When a process is imported in the lower levels details, they must be numbered.

e Process and data flow names have the first letter of each word must be a capital letter.

The symbol used in DFD are shown be

6.1 INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEM DESIGN

Design is the first step into the development phase for any engineered product or
system. Design is a creative process. A good design is the key to effective system. The
term “design” is defined as “the process of applying various techniques and principles for
the purpose of defining a process or a system in sufficient detail to permit its physical
realization”. It may be defined as a process of applying various techniques and principles
for the purpose of defining a device, a process or a system in sufficient detail to permit its
physical realization. Software design sits at the technical kernel of the software
engineering process and is applied regardless of the development paradigm that is used.

The system design develops the architectural detail required to build a system or
product. As in the case of any systematic approach, this software too has undergone the best
possible design phase fine tuning all efficiency, performance and accuracy levels. The
design phase is a transition from a user oriented document to a document to the

programmers or database personnel. System design goes through two phases of

development: Logical and Physical Design.

6.2 LOGICAL DESIGN

The logical flow of a system and define the boundaries of a system. It includes the

 
   
     
   
     
   
   

following steps:

e Reviews the current physical system — its data flows, file content, volumes,
frequencies etc.

e Prepares output specifications — that is, determines the format, content and
frequency of reports.

Prepares input specifications— format, content and most of the input functions.
ePrepares edit, security and control specifications.

Specifies the implementation plan.

TAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 29
_ FARMER'S BUDDY

   
   

ePrepares a logical design walk through of the information flow, output, input,

controls and implementation plan.

Reviews benefits, costs, target dates and system constraints.

6.3 PHYSICAL DESIGN

Physical system produces the working systems by define the design specifications
that

tell the programmers exactly what the candidate system must do. It includes the following
steps.

e Design the physical system.
¢ Specify input and output media.
Design the database and specify backup procedures.

¢ Design physical information flow through the system and a physical design Walk
through.

ePlan system implementation.
e Prepare a conversion schedule and target date.
e Determine training procedures, courses and timetable.

Devise a test and implementation plan and specify any new hardware/software.

e Update benefits, costs, and conversion date and system constraints
Design/Specification activities:

eConcept formulation.

eProblem understanding.

eHigh level requirements proposals.
eFeasibility study.

eRequirements engineering.

eArchitectural design.

6.4 MODULE DESIGN

Admin

The Administrator logs in using the admin login. In this module two operations

are done. During login the Login and Password is verified with that in the database.

6.4.1 INPUT DESIGN

The design of input focuses on controlling the amount of input required, controlling
the errors, avoiding delay, avoiding extra steps and keeping the process simple. The input
is designed in such a way so that it provides security and ease of use with retaining the
privacy.

Input Design considered the following things:

o What data should be given as input?

o How the data should be arranged or coded?

o The dialog to guide the operating personnel in providing input.

o Methods for preparing input validations and steps to follow when error

occur.
OBJECTIVES

Input Design is the process of converting a user-oriented description of the input into
a computer-based system. This design is important to avoid errors in the data input process
and show the correct direction to the management for getting correct information from

the computerized system.

When the data is entered it will check for its validity. Data can be entered with the
help of screens. Appropriate messages are provided as when needed so that the user will not
be in a maize of instant. Thus the objective of input design is to create an input layout that is

easy to follow

6.4.2 OUTPUT DESIGN

 

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 31
 

A quality output is one, which meets the requirements of the end user and presents the
information clearly. In output design it is determined how the information is to be
displaced for immediate need and also the hard copy output. It is the most important and
direct source information to the user. Efficient and intelligent output design improves the
system’s relationship to help user decision-making.

Designing computer output should proceed in an organized, well thought out manner;
the right output must be developed while ensuring that each output element is designed so
that people will find the system can use easily and effectively. When analysis design
computer output, they should:

@ Identify the specific output that is needed to meet the requirements.
w Select methods for presenting information.
@ Create document, report, or other formats that contain information produced by

the system.

6.5 DATABASE DESIGN

A database is an organized mechanism that has the capability of storing information
through which a user can retrieve stored information in an effective and efficient manner.
The data is the purpose of any database and must _ be protected.
The database design is a two level process. In the first step, user requirements are
gathered together and a database is designed which will meet these requirements as

clearly as possible. This step is called Information Level Design and it is taken
independent of any individual DBMS.

In the second step, this Information level design is transferred into a design for the
specific DBMS that will be used to implement the system in question. This step is called
Physical Level Design, concerned with the characteristics of the specific DBMS that will
be used.

A database design runs parallel with the system design. The organization of the

data in the database is aimed to achieve the following two major objectives.

 

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 32

 
 

@ Data Integrity

w@ Data independence

Normalization is the process of decomposing the attributes in an application, which
results in a set of tables with very simple structure. The purpose of normalization is to
make tables as simple as possible. Normalization is carried out in this system for the

following reasons.

e To structure the data so that there is no repetition of data, this helps in saving.
e To permit simple retrieval of data in response to query and report request.

« To simplify the maintenance of the data through updates, insertions, deletions.
e To reduce the need to restructure or reorganize data which new application

requirements arise
RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS):

A relational model represents the database as a collection of relations. Each relation
resembles a table of values or file of records. In formal relational model terminology, a
row is called a tuple, a column header is called an attribute and the table is called a
relation. A relational database consists of a collection of tables, each of which is assigned

a unique name. A row in a tale represents a set of related values.
RELATIONS, DOMAINS & ATTRIBUTES:

A table is a relation. The rows in a table are called tuples. A tuple is an ordered set of
n elements. Columns are referred to as attributes. Relationships have been set between
every table in the database. This ensures both Referential and Entity Relationship
Integrity. A domain D is a set of atomic values. A common method of specifying a
domain is to specify a data type from which the data values forming the domain are
drawn. It is also useful to specify a name for the domain to help in interpreting its values.

Every value in a relation is atomic, that is not decomposable.

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 33
FARMER’S BUDDY

RELATIONSHIPS:

Table relationships are established using Key. The two main keys of prime
importance are Primary Key & Foreign Key. Entity Integrity and Referential Integrity
Relationships can be established with these keys.Entity Integrity enforces that no Primary
Key can have null values. Referential Integrity enforces that no Primary Key can have null
values.

Referential Integrity for each distinct Foreign Key value, there must exist a matching
Primary Key value in the same domain. Other key are Super Key and Candidate Keys.
Relationships have been set between every table in the database. This ensures both

Referential and Entity Relationship Integrity.
NORMALIZATION:

As the name implies, it denoted putting things in the normal form. The

application developer via normalization tries to achieve a sensible organization of data into

proper tables and columns and where names can be easily correlated to the data by the user.

Normalization eliminates repeating groups at data and thereby avoids data redundancy
which proves to be a great burden on the computer resources.

These includes:

w Normalize the data.

w Choose proper names for the tables and columns.

mw Choose the proper name for the data.

First Normal Form:

The First Normal Form states that the domain of an attribute must include
only atomic values and that the value of any attribute in a tuple must be a single value from
the domain of that attribute. In other words 1NF disallows “relations within relations” or
“relations as attribute values within tuples”. The only attribute values permitted by 1NF

are single atomic or indivisible value.

 

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 34

 
FARMER'S BUDDY

The first step is to put the data into First Normal Form. This can be donor
by moving data into separate tables where the data is of similar type in each table. Each table
is given a Primary Key or Foreign Key as per requirement of the project. In this we form
new relations for each nonatomic attribute or nested relation. This eliminated repeating
groups of data. A relation is said to be in first normal form if only if it satisfies the constraints

that contain the primary key only.
Second Normal Form:

According to Second Normal Form, for relations where primary key contains
multiple attributes, no nonkey attribute should be functionally dependent on a part of the
primary key.

In this we decompose and setup a new relation for each partial key with its
dependent attributes. Make sure to keep a relation with the original primary key and any
attributes that are fully functionally dependent on it. This step helps in taking out data that is
only dependant on apart ofthe key.

A relation is said to be in second normal form if and only if it satisfies all the
first normal form conditions for the primary key and every non-primary key attributes of the

relation is fully dependent on its primary key alone.

Third Normal Form:

According to Third Normal Form, Relation should not have a nonkey attribute

functionally determined by another non-key attribute or by a set of nonkey attributes. That

is, there should be no. transitive dependency on the primary key.

In this we decompose and set up relation that includes the nonkey attributes that
functionally determines other nonkey attributes. This step is taken to get rid of anything
that does not depend entirely on the Primary Key.

A relation is said to be in third normal form if only if it is in second normal
form and more over the non key attributes of the relation should not be depend on other non-

key attribute.

Testing is the process of examining the software to compare the actual behavior with that of
the excepted behavior. The major goal of software testing is to demonstrate that faults are not
present. In order to achieve this goal the tester executes the program with the intent of finding
errors. Though testing cannot show absence of errors but by not showing their presence it is
considered that these are not present.

System testing is defined as the process by which one detects the defects in the
software. Any software development organization or team has to perform several processes.
Software testing is one among them. It is the final opportunity of any programmer to detect
and rectify any defects that may have appeared during the software development stage.
Testing is a process of testing a program with the explicit intention of finding errors that
makes the program fail. In short system testing and quality assurance is a review in software
products and related documentation for completion, correctness, reliability and
maintainability.

System testing is the first stage of implementation, which is aimed at ensuring that
the system works accurately and efficiently before live operation commences. Testing is vital
to the success of the system. System testing makes a logical assumption that if all the parts of
the system are correct and the goal will be successfully achieved. A series of testing are
performed for the proposed system before the proposed system is ready for user acceptance
testing.

The testing steps are,

> Unit testing

> Integration testing
> Validation testing
> Output Testing

» User Acceptance Testing

> Alpha Testing

> Beta Testing

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 89

 
System Testing provides the file assurance that software once validated must be combined
with all other system elements. System testing verifies whether all elements have been
combined properly and that overall system function and performance is achieved. After the
integration of modules, the validation test was carried out over the system. It was found that

all the modules work well together and meet the overall system function and performance.
8.1. UNIT TESTING

Unit testing is carried out screen-wise, each screen being identified as an object.
Attention is diverted to individual modules, independently to one another to locate errors.
This has enabled the detection of errors in coding and logic.

Various test cases are prepared. For each module these test cases are implemented and
it is checked whether the module is executed as per the requirements and outputs the desired
result. In this test each service input and output parameters are checked.

In unit testing,
» Module interface was tested to ensure that information properly flows into and out
of the program under test.
> Boundary condition was tested to ensure that module operates properly at
boundaries established to limit or restrict processing.
> All independent paths through the control structures were executed to ensure that
all statements in the modules have been executed at least once.

Error handling paths were also tested.

8.2. INTEGRATION TESTING

Integration testing is a systematic technique for constructing the program structure while
at the same time conducting tests to uncover errors associated with interfacing. Unit tested
module were taken and a single program structure was built that has been dictated by the

design. Incremental integration has been adopted here.

The modules are tested separately for accuracy and modules are integrated together

using bottom up integration i.e., by integrating from moving from bottom to the top. The

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 90

 
FARMER’S BUDDY

system is checked and errors found during integration are rectified. In this testing, all the
individual modules were combined and the module wise shifting was verified to be alright.
The entire software was developed and tested in small segments, where errors were easy to
locate and rectify. Program builds (group of modules) were constructed corresponding to the
successful testing of user interaction, data manipulation analysis, and display processing and
database management.

The integration testing is performed in the “Tech Mate” by combining the three
modules i.e.; by combining the technician and user modules, or by admin and technician
modules or by combining the admin and technician modules and found all are running

without any error.

8.3. VALIDATION TESTING

Validation testing is done to ensure complete assembly of the error-free software.
Validation can be termed successful only if it functions in manner. Reasonably expected by

the customer under validation is alpha and beta testing. Alpha testing is where the end user

tests the system rather than the developer, but in a controlled environment. The software is

used on a natural setting with the developer monitoring the user using the system. The

developer records the errors and usage problems encountered by the user.

8.4. OUTPUT TESTING

After performing the validation testing, the next step is output testing of the proposed
system, since could be useful if it does not produce the required output in the specific format.
The output generated by the system under considerations is tested asking the users about the

format required by them.
8.5. USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING

User acceptance of a system is the key factor for the success of any system. The
system under considerations is tested for user’s acceptance by constantly keeping in touch
with the prospective system users at the time of developing and making of hardware

management software.

 

JAI BHARATH ARTS AND SCIENCE COLLEGE 91

 
FARMER’S BUDDY

8.6. ALPHA TESTING

Alpha testing is simulated or actual operational testing by potential users/customers or
an independent test team at the developers’ site. Alpha testing is often employed for off-the-
shelf software as a form of internal acceptance testing, before the software goes to beta

testing.

8.7. BETA TESTING

Beta testing comes after alpha testing. Versions of the software, known as beta
versions, are released to a limited audience outside of the programming team. The software is

released to groups of people so that further testing can ensure the product has few faults or

bugs. Sometimes, beta versions are made available to the open public to increase the

feedback field to a maximal number of future users.

The user person conducts beta testing at one more sites. The developer is not present
during these tests. Hence, beta test can be said as the live application of software on an
environment that cannot be controlled by the developer. The sales person takes down the
problems encountered during beta testing and reports to the developer at regular intervals.
The developer makes suitable modifications to the software henceforth.

The client-side validation is done in this testing phase. It is checked whether the data
passed to each service is valid or not. Entering incorrect values does the validation testing
and it is checked whether the errors are being considered. Incorrect values are to be

discarded. The errors are rectified.

The implementation is the final state and it is an important phase. It involves the individual

programming; system testing, user training and the operational running of developed

proposed system that constitutes the application subsystems. A major task of preparing for
implementation is education of users, which should really have been taken place much earlier
in the project when they were being involved in the investigation and design work. During
the implementation phase system actually takes physical shape. In order to develop a system
implemented planning is very essential.

The implementation phase of the software development is concerned with
translating design specification into source code. The user tests the developed system and
changes are made according to their needs. Our system has been successfully implemented.
Before implementation several tests have been conducted to ensure that no errors are
encountered during the operation. The implementation phase ends with an evaluation of the
system after placing into the operation for a period of time.

The process of putting the developed system in actual use is called system
implementation. This includes all those activities that take place to convert from old system
to new system. The system can be implemented only after testing is done and is found to be
working to specifications. The implementation stage is a systems project in its own right. The

implementation stage involves following tasks:
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

Test system with sample data

Detection and correction of errors

Make the necessary changes in the system
Check with the existing system

Installation of hardware and software utilities

Training and involvement of user personnel

Maintenance is actually the implementation of the post implementation review plan. As
important as it is, many programmers and analyst are reluctant to perform or identify
themselves with maintains effort. There are psychological, personalities and professional
reasons for this. In any case first class effort must be made to ensure that the software
changes are made properly and in time to keep the system intone with user specification.
Maintenance is expensive. One way to reduce Maintenance costs are through maintenance
management and software modifications audits. Software modifications consists of program
rewrites system level updates, re-audits of low ranking software, reduced maintenance

backlog and higher satisfaction and moral among the maintenance of staff.

Even when the new system has gone live there may be need for some
system design activity. This will see from changes that are necessitated by the dynamic
nature of the system and its environment. Changes may be required to correct faults or to

bring about improvements, and may arise as part of normal running of the system or as a

result of a review of the system performance. Changes or amendments and documentations

and perhaps handled by specialist group of maintenance staff.

A computer system is secure if neither its availability to attain its objectives not its
availability to survive can be adversely affected by an unwanted event.A computer based
security is the combination of many assets or resourses designed to perform some function or
to provide service.The facility to impose strict authorization is completely vested in the hands
of the system respectively.Only valid users can enter into the system.They have to provide a
valid username and password to provide that they are valid users.if any one of them is
wrong,access is denied.At register time admin provide a OTP security check up for user
account validation and its help to admin avoid fake ids.

System security is refers to the technical innovation and

procedures applied to the hardware and operating system to protect against deliberate or

accidental damage from a defined threat. In contrast, data security is the protection of data
loss, disclosure, modification and destruction. The security features are considered while

developing the system, so as to avoid the errors and omissions that may lead to serious

problems.

The administrator has the freedom to accept or reject the new farmers and users. Only the
administrator farmer and user can login to “FAEMER’S BUDDY". This system was tested with
a lots of test details and found to be working correctly. All the requirements are built into the
system. It produces data output in the required format.

The developed system has mainly three parts administrator, farmers and user. It is developed
using PHP and MySQL Server .The system can be easily modified or expanded. The software
provides all the facilities required in the system, the reports are user friendly. The software
requires less effort to operate.

The software is developed with scalability in mind. Additional modules can be

easily added when necessary. The software is developed with modular approach. All modules

in the system have been tested and put together to form the main system. Finally the system

tested with real data and everything worked successfully. Thus the system has fulfilled all the

objectives identified and is able to replace the existing system.
